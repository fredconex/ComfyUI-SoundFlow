# ComfyUI_SoundFlow 

This is a bunch of nodes for ComfyUI to help with sound work.

Nodes available:
- Mixer
- Silence Trimmer
- Concatenator
- Get/Set Length
- Trim
- Fade In/Out
- Ducking *
- Simple Compressor *
- 7-Band Equalizer
- Preview/Player

The nodes with * are nodes that require the extended function provided by the compiled Rust library (effects.dll), it's currently provided only for Windows but I may provide it for Linux and Mac at some point further.
